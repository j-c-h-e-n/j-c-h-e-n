- Hey I'm James (@j-c-h-e-n). I'm a HS Senior in the Chesapeake Bay area and I'm self-teaching myself different languages.
- I'm willing to learn just about anything programming related and I will pursue it if it piques my interest.
- Currently I'm attempting to code a system-wide application time-tracker.
  - Ex:
    "Google Chrome": "(Time spent in hours and minutes)",
    "VSCode": "HH:MM",
    "Valorant": "HH:MM",
    "Mail": "HH:MM",
    "Discord": "HH:MM",
